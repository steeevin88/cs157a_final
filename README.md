# GymRatz (Personal Record Tracker Application + Gym Management Application)

Our project is a personal record (PR) tracker, used to track personal records at the gym. 

As avid gym-goers, it’s become increasingly important for us to track our progress in lifting weights at the gym. A valuable way to measure our gym progression and performance is by tracking our records of the weights we lift. For example, the bench press is a common exercise practiced by gym-goers. If someone were to bench press 135 lbs. one week, and then 155 lbs. two months later, we could reliably claim that such an individual has made progress. Additionally, personal records may be difficult to remember. Perhaps an individual pushed their limits and lifted a heavier weight than normal; however, upon returning to the gym, they may have forgotten this information and lost potential progress. 

Ultimately, our application aims to mediate both issues by providing a professional way to track/log one’s progression in physical fitness. However, this isn't the application only purpose; this application further serves to manage gym information. This include, but is not limited to, features such as tracking gym goals, workouts, and finding gyms posted by other "GymRatz" users.

## Features

* Account Registration: Users will be able to register for an account by providing an email, username, and password. This authentication system will be secure: passwords will be encrypted with JWT tokens.

* Exercise Log: Users will be able to log personal records for various gym exercises. These logs will include common associated details, including but not limited to exercise name, the weight lifted, the number of repetitions, and the date achieved. 

* Goal Setting: Users will be able to set goals and compare them to current their progress.

* Gym Finder: Users will be able to post and view gym locations; this will help other gym-goers find new, potentially lesser known gyms.

* Motivation Wall: Users will be able to create motivation walls. On these walls, everyone can post motivational messages for others to see.
