# PR Tracker Application

Our project is a personal record tracker, used to track personal records at the gym. 

As avid gym-goers, it’s become increasingly important for us to track our progress in lifting weights at the gym. A valuable way to measure our gym progression and performance is by tracking our records of the weights we lift. For example, the bench press is a common exercise practiced by gym-goers. If someone were to bench press 135 lbs. one week, and then 155 lbs. two months later, we could reliably claim that such an individual has made progress. Additionally, personal records may be difficult to remember. Perhaps an individual pushed their limits and lifted a heavier weight than normal; however, upon returning to the gym, they may have forgotten this information and lost potential progress. 

Ultimately, our application aims to mediate both issues by providing a professional way to track/log one’s progression in physical fitness.
